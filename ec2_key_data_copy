# STEP1: 
  Create temporary instance (Server2) with a new key pair

# STEP2: 
  Stop the original instance (Server1) & detach the original volume 

# STEP3: 
  Attach the original volume to temporary instance

# COMMANDS
lsblk                                                                    # check the list of block storages and their mount points, note the name of new volume
sudo mkdir /disk2                                                        # create directory to mount the original volume
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf1                                             # to create a filesystem (it is used to organize file structure for external devices)
sudo mount -o nouuid /dev/xvdf1 /disk2                                   # create mount point in temporary volume 
                                                                         # (Here 'xvdf1' is an name of volume, replace it with actual volume name xvdb1, xvdc1, etc from lsblk command)
                                                                         # nouuid: No Universally Unique Identifier, this is useful when a disk is copied from another system
cp .ssh/authorized_keys /disk2/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys        # copy key data from temp volume to original volume
sudo umount /disk2                                                       # unmount original volume

# STEP4: 
  Go to AWS EC2 console & Stop the temporary instance.

# STEP5: 
  Detach Original Volume from Temp Instance; and attach it to original Instance with the device name '/dev/xvda'.

# STEP6: 
  We can now access our original instance w/ a new key pair.

# Note:
# What is nouuid?
  nouuid: No Universally Unique Identifier
  This command is useful when using a disk copied from another system

# To make the volume PERSISTENT (i.e., permanently mount to VM even if VM restarts) then follow below steps:
sudo vi /etc/fstab
# add below
/dev/xvdf1 /disk2 ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
# here: /dev/xvdf1 is your volume
        /disk2 is the mount point
        ext4 is the filesystem
